# Portfolio

Data analytics and machine learning portfolio covering the full data stack — from SQL database design and Python exploratory analysis to large-scale computing on Databricks and interactive reports in Power BI.

## Projects

**Databricks (Machine Learning)** — fare prediction on 38M+ records using PySpark MLlib (Linear Regression, Random Forest, GBT) and PyTorch neural network, built on Azure Databricks with data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.

**Agentic AI (LangGraph and OpenAI)** — agentic workflow that autonomously trains, validates and selects the best machine learning model using LangGraph and GPT-4o-mini.

**Python (Data Preprocessing and EDA)** — Data Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on a retail orders dataset covering univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis, customer segmentation with KMeans and statistical hypothesis testing.

**SQL** — relational database design with primary and foreign key constraints, analytical queries using window functions and subqueries, and views for reporting.

**Power BI** — multi-page interactive reports with star schema data model, drill-through, decomposition tree, time series analysis and geographic map visuals.
